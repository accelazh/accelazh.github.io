           https://gigaom.com/reprint/gigaom-radar-for-high-performance-cloud-file-storage-238122-hammerspace/
            1. very good
            2. Vendor insights
                1. Amazon
                    1. Strengths: Amazon offers an extensive set of cloud file storage solutions that can address the needs of a broad spectrum of personas and use cases, providing great flexibility and compatibility with popular file system options through its FSx service while also delivering a cloud-native experience with EFS and hybrid cloud options with Amazon File Cache.
                    2. Challenges: Amazon’s extensive portfolio requires organizations to properly understand the company’s offerings and the alignment of services to specific use cases. The rich ecosystem is also complex, with analytics and management capabilities. The platform can deliver outstanding value, but it requires a thorough understanding of its full potential.
                2. Google
                    1. Strengths: Google Cloud file storage capabilities are improving, partly thanks to the availability of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Filestore is an exciting solution for organizations that rely heavily on GCP. It provides a native experience with high throughput and sustained performance for latency-sensitive workloads.
                    2. Challenges: Google Filestore has improved, but it still has limitations in scalability and customization. Users needing highly scalable storage should consider other options.
                3. Hammerspace
                    0. good innovative solution. a single global namespace atop all cloud vendors
                    1. Strengths: Hammerspace’s Parallel Global File System offers a very balanced set of capabilities with replication and hybrid and multicloud capabilities through the power of metadata.
                    2. Challenges: Built-in, proactive ransomware detection capabilities are currently missing.
                4. Microsoft Azure
                    1. Strengths: Microsoft offers a broad portfolio with multiple options, protocols, use cases, and performance tiers that allow organizations to consume cloud file storage in a cost-efficient manner. It also offers enterprise-grade multicloud capabilities with its first-party Azure NetApp Files solution.
                    2. Challenges: There are no global namespace management capabilities to abstract the underlying file share complexity for the end user. There are also limitations based on the different share types, although Microsoft is working on increasing maximum volume sizes. The various offerings can appear very complex and therefore intimidating for smaller organizations.
                5. NetApp
                    0. Interesting. NetApp ONTAP integrated with almost every cloud vendors natively
                    1. Strengths: Available as a first-party offering on all three major hyperscalers, NetApp offers an unrivaled set of enterprise-grade capabilities that enable seamless data mobility and a consistent, simplified operational experience. Cyber resiliency, data management, and data protection capabilities increase the overall value of the platform to offer an industry-leading cloud file storage experience.
                    2. Challenges: Despite notable improvements, the NetApp portfolio still remains complex to newcomers, though using BlueXP as an entry point is an effective way to remediate this perception issue.

                2. AWS strength and weakness
                    1. Strengths
                        1. Large-scale capacity and scalability offerings
                        2. Extensive portfolio of flexible service offerings
                        3. Core focus on digital businesses
                        4. Proven suitability for the traditional enterprise
                        5. Broad and deep ecosystem
                    2. Weakness
                        1. Building blocks, not solutions
                        2. Choice overload
                        3. Limited architectural transparency
                        4. Oriented toward distributed cloud, not hybrid cloud
                        5. Limited traditional disaster recovery (DR) capabilities
                            1. i.e. AWS has not many regions in some countries, that cannot offer distant but still in-country DR sites
                    3. neutral
                        1. AWS is built around the assumption that organizations want to be agile and innovative
                        2. AWS’s release velocity is not only fast, but also unpredictable
                3. AliCloud
                    1. Strong China top 1. Higher score than Google Cloud. Apsara Stack AI
                    2. suffers from the lacking part is global offering, inconsistent china/global offering, limited ecosystem for multicloud customers
                    3. Sometimes there are multiple services with what seem to be very similar feature sets, but each service has nuances that make it more optimal for particular use cases.
                    4. Be mindful of the dearth of English-language documentation
                4. summarized key abilities of Azure
                    1. Mission critical KPIs
                        1. run long time without failure
                        2. deterministic and consistent performance

                    7. Run Azure on-premise customer datacenter, connect services to Azure
                    8. Security, confidential, zero trust, enclave
                    9. HPC, AI, Analytics workload
                    10. working with 3rd party vendors

    vision in 1 ~ 3 years
      1. in general, the vision is more a wording for startups, where leader needs insight in one or a few directions but with predictions, depth, and belief
         to understand overall trends, the wording "trends" already have a lot of study, which can be easily searched on google.
                    for the daily work, the vision is more like a breakdown, to more specifically know what our team should do in the following 1 ~ 3 years, and where are our SWOT - Weakness/bottleneck, Strength, Opportunities, Risks
      2. what are the bottlenecks/directions in our xstream team in the following 1~3 years
                      1. scale-out the metadata, the data, the operation management. balance and migration.
                      2. reduce COGS, improve performance, more sellable IOPS/capacity, less amplification.
                      3. deterministic performance, better request SLA. improving customer request resolving time and satisfaction.
                      4. data reliability and corruption. security hardening.
                     5. fitting working with new type of hardware layout, new generation, new SKU, Rack count, geo-distribution, etc
                      6. shipping new technology, e.g. storage device, e.g. CPU feature, into our system.
                      7. internal technical debts, better design and refactor, adding metrics, measures, making visible and systematic
    3. what is the storage at world industry position?
    4. what is the storage at our competitor position? AWS/Google, SAN/NFS vendors, Data backup vendors / Data management
    5. what kind of team, guys, and how we work and organize, will be, after 3~5 years?

    1. related: http://accelazh.github.io/technology/Roadmap-to-Technical-Leadership - "Build Information Flow"
        2. Storage Field Day - Window of Industrial invest - Captured MinIO, VastData
            1. I need window to know how storage field in industry invest, acquisition on new technologies
               compared to paper / academics, industrial memory flow reveals true technology trends and visions
            2. Use key startup, acquisitions I found to reverse track which web sources can feedback me the industrial invest flow
                1. VastData - youtube search - locate Storage Feild Day / Tech Field Day. Similar for MinIO
