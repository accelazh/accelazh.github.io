1. public cloud pricing study
    1. AWS pricing
        1. "There are four ways to pay for Amazon EC2 instances: On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances" "You can also pay for Dedicated Hosts"
        2. EC2 pricing: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
            1. on-demond: t2.xlarge 4core16GBmem $0.1856/hrs

        4. S3 pricing: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
            1. US East: First 50TB/month: standard storage: $0.023/GB/Month
            2. Request pricing: US East: GET 0.004/10,000req PUT 0.005/1,000req
    2. Azure pricing
        1. Blob storage pricing: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/
            1. LRS: East US 2: First 50TB $0.0184/GB/month
            2. operations and data transfer: hot write $0.05/10,000op, hot read $0.004/10,000op
        2. Disks pricing: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/
            1. Managed Disk: HDD: S30 1TB: $40.96.
            2. transactions: $0.0005/10,000tx
    3. Aliyun pricing
        1. ECS instances: https://cn.aliyun.com/price/product#/ecs/detail
            1. ecs.g5.xlarge 4core16GBmem 513CYN/month
        2. Block storage: https://cn.aliyun.com/price/product?spm=5176.8030368.333906.7.59075fee9YuhOC#/disk/detail
            1. data disk: 0.28CYN/GB/Month
        3. Object storage （OSS): https://cn.aliyun.com/price/product?spm=5176.8030368.333906.4.59075fee9YuhOC#/oss/detail
            1. standard: 0.148CYN/GB/month
            2. requests: 0.01CYN/10,000req
    4. P.S. I don't see cost advantage from Aliyun over Azure or AWS

2. hardware prices by CapEx and OpEx
    1. Amazon hardware prices
        1. 1TB HDD: $164
        2. 4 * 16GB DRAM: $715

           Samsung 960 PRO Series - 512GB PCIe NVMe: $307
           Optane SSD 900P 280GB: $388
           Intel SSD 750 Series PCIe AIC 1.2TB Internal SSD: $1150
           Intel SSD 600p Series (1.0TB, M.2 80mm PCIe 3.0 x4, 3D1, TLC): $424
    2. server power consumption
        1. ~850watt/hrs: http://www.zdnet.com/article/toolkit-calculate-datacenter-server-power-usage/
        2. server power calculator: https://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Tools/serverpowerusage.php
            1. 300servers * $0.0808/kwh ~= $15040/month
    3. rough cost estimate: 300 servers each with 1TB disk
        1. $income/month: 500servers * 60disks * 1000GB * $0.0184/GB/month ~= $550k/month
           $power/month: 500servers * 850w * 0.001k * $0.2/kwh * 720hrs/month ~= $61k/month
           $hardware/month: 500servers * (60disks * 164 + 1dram * 715 + 2cpu * 764 + 100) * 3whatever / (3 * 12) ~= $510k
        2. looks like public cloud storage can make some money. the cost is close.
           that requires high density disks. high util efficiency. careful cost management.

3. costs analysis in papers/talks
    1. Pergamum: Replacing Tape with Energy Efficient, Reliable, Disk-Based Archival Storage

        1. profitability, sellable capacity, per GB COGS
        2. highend hardwares are more expensive, but provide more consolidated IOPS/latency/capacity to sell.
           and use more power usually, the total price may drop however we cannot say
