The time-series algorithms once selected and evaluated to build a analyzing and self-learning system for Openstack application awareness. OPs are always collecting bunches of metrics which are essentially time-series.

### Fourier Transform (FT)

__What it can do__

  * Decompose f(t) to combination of basic waves (sine/cosine).
  * Smoothing.
  * Test periodicity
      * i.e. Largest cycle period from FFT is significantly smaller than data span.
  * Forecasting and modeling, if time-series is periodic.

__Summary__

  * Transform f(t), which is on __t__ time domain, to F(w), which is on __w__ frequency domain. F(w) = f(t)'s component on frequency __w__.
  * FT transforms time-series f(t) into a sum of sine/cosine.
  * FT is invertible, i.e. a FT decomposition of sine/cosine waves is unique.
  * Suitable for periodic functions. Non-periodic functions result in non-constant F(w) or infinite sum of since/cosine.
  * Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used for discrete computer sampling, with time complexity O(n*n).
  * __Fast Fourier Transform__ (FFT) is the faster version __approximation__ of DFT, with time complexity O(n*log(n)).
  * Do FFT multiple times for better smoothing, according to [Netflix Scryer](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/12/scryer-netflixs-predictive-auto-scaling.html).

__Theory__

[Euler's formula](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AC%A7%E6%8B%89%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F) demonstrates the basic connection between complex numbers and triangular functions.

![FFT formula 1](/images/time-series-fft-integral.jpg "FFT formula 1")

How F(w) is calculated? e^iwt = cos(wt) + isin(wt), which is one of f(t)'s wave component. f(t)*e^iwt test f's correlation with e^iwt. The bigger correlation, the bigger coefficient, which is F(w), results in.

!8394323_1298253739kqo6.jpg!

To reverse F(w) to f(t), we simply add each wave component together. A wave component is e^iwt, the cos(wt) + isin(wt), multiply its coefficient F(w).

![FFT formula 2](/images/time-series-fft-differential.jpg "FFT formula 2")

How FFT is used for smoothing? "FFT Filter smoothing is accomplished by removing Fourier components with frequencies higher than a cutoff frequency", according to [here](http://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Products/Origin/DataAnalysis/SignalProcessing/SmoothingAndFitting&pid=78). Also cutoff amplitude can be used. Choose the threshold wisely.

### Moving Average (MA)

__What it can do__

  * Smoothing for __long-term__ trends.
  * To see long-term trends.

__Summary__

  * Replace the current point with the (weighted) average of it and nearby range.
  * Moving average smoothed curve usually fits the originally one __badly__, but become useful to see __long-term__ trends. This is different from FFT smoothing.

__Theory__

Simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted mean of the previous __n__ data.

![Simple moving average](/images/time-series-ma-sma.png "Simple moving average")

Exponential moving average (EMA), or exponential smoothing ([wiki|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing]), gives weighted average from current point to beginning, where the weight for each older point decreases exponentially.

![Exponential moving average](/images/time-series-ma-ema.png "Exponential moving average")

There are yet many other moving average algorithms.

### ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

__What it can do__

  * Time-series data modeling and forecasting.
  * Trends, circulation, seasonality is taken cared.

__Summary__

  * Seen from __random process__ (statistics) perspective, rather than wave.
  * Time-series is considered as random process of autoregressive model + moving-average model, or informally a random-trend + random-walk.
      * Random-trend is recognized by differencing, i.e. y\(i) - y(i-1), the autoregressive model.
      * Random-walk is recognized by moving-average model.
  * Parameters:
      * p is the number of autoregressive terms,
      * d is the number of nonseasonal differences, and
      * q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.
  * Autocorrelation is used to determine lag factor p & q.
  * A bit complex.
  * Very widely used in forecasting, such as marketing data, stock trends.

__Theory__

Given ARMA(p' ,q) model:

![ARIMA formula 1](/images/time-series-arima-1.png "ARIMA formula 1")

Assume the left side polynomial has a unitary root of multiplicity d

![ARIMA formula 2](/images/time-series-arima-2.png "ARIMA formula 2")

ARIMA(p,d,q) process expresses it with p=p'−d

![ARIMA formula 3](/images/time-series-arima-3.png "ARIMA formula 3")

Above are random process models.

### Classical Decomposition

__What it can do__

  * Decompose time-series into trend+seasonal+remainder

__Summary__

  * __Not recommended now__
  * Essentially use Moving Average (MA)

__Theory__

Step 1
  * Calculate trend-cycle component = N-MA(series), or trend = 2×N-MA(series)

Step 2
  * Calculate the detrended series: s2 = series - trend

Step 3
  * Taking month March as an example, seasonal index is the average of all the March values in s2. Then adjust seasonal index so that they adds to zero. seasonal component = seasonal index stringed together.

Step 4
  * Remainder component = series - trend - season component.

__More__

  * Triangular fitting?
  * Autocorrelation may be relevant to cycle finding

### Neuron Network

__What it can do__

  * Time-series modeling and forecasting

__Summary__

  * Use neuron network model for time=series
  * Previous N points are used as input for the model
  * Equipped in R.
  * Magically it works.
  * Has seasonal models.

__Theory__

Neuron network model, with previous N points in time-series as input to the model.

__References__

  * [OTexts Neural network models](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/9/3)

### ACF & PACF

__What it can do__

  * Residual diagnostics
      * The reminder component of time-series should contain no pattern. Use these tests for it.
  * Detect seasonality, according to [here](http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Time-Series-Analysis#analysis)

__Summary__

  * ACF, autocorrelation function, is used to test reminder
  * Also "Average Test / Durbin-Watson Test" can be used for same purpose
  * Small p-value of Durbin-Watson Test indicates significant autocorrelation remaining.

__Theory__

Average of reminder component, if no pattern remaining, should be zero.

ACF or autocorrelation of reminder component, if no pattern remaining, should show not significant spike or lag.

### Periodogram

__What it can do__

  * To detect any periodicities/seasonality

__Summary__

  * Periodogram is the basic modulus-squared of the Fourier transform.
  * Essentially same with Power Spectral Density, categorized in "spectral analysis"
  * The squared radius of epicycle.
  * It is graphical technique, which usually requires manual inspection.
  * Other seasonality detection [methods|http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc443.htm], which are also graphical techniques:
      * A __run sequence plot__ will often show seasonality.
      * A __seasonal subseries plot__ is a specialized technique for showing seasonality.
      * Multiple __box plots__ can be used as an alternative to the seasonal subseries plot to detect seasonality.
      * The __autocorrelation plot__ can help identify seasonality.

__Theory__

First, remember the Fourier Transform decompose time-series Xn into

![Fourier decompose](/images/time-series-fourier-decompose.png "Fourier decompose")

v represents the frequency.

Periodogram is a graph/function with v as abscissa (horizontal axis), and ordinates (vertical axis) as:

![Periodogram formula](/images/time-series-periodogram.png "Periodogram formula")

I don't remember whether the coefficient "1/2" is correct, but periodogram does show "the basic modulus-squared of the Fourier transform". Remember fourier transform in complex format, the sin(..) part is "i*sin(..)".

But, it is NOT finished yet. Basic periodogram has "Leakage Problem" and maturer methods are derived from this: refer to [http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Time-Series-Analysis#problem].

### My Crafted Spike Detection

__What it can do__

  * Spike/peak detection

__Summary__

  * Use standard deviation to detect outliers.
  * Peak outliers are taken as spikes.
  * Neighbor spike points which are not significantly different are merged.

__Theory__

Step 1: De-trend. Remove trend component from the original time-series.

Step 2: Identifier outliers, who's \|value-mean\| >= a*standard_deviation. The "a" is a changeable parameter, usually 3.

* Sometime it is useful to omit Step 2 by setting a to 0.

Step 3: Select from outliers, who is larger/smaller than its neighbor on both sides. Call them S points.

Step 4: Merge two S points A & B, if

  * A & B are both above/below mean, and
  * points between A & B are all outliers of same side to mean, but not S point, and
  * NOT (at least one point X between A & B, min(\|A.value-X.value\|, \|B.value-X.value\|) is larger than threshold k). k is a changeable parameter. i.e. a gap exists between A & B.

A, B is merged to whom is farther from mean.

Step 5: Merge all S points pair satisfy Step 4's condition.

The remaining S points are spikes.

  * There are yet more methods for searching spike/peak points.* For example, find maxima points who is larger than left and right neighbor points within distance k. Refer to \[[Simple Algorithms for Peak Detection in Time-Series](http://www.tcs-trddc.com/trddc_website/pdf/SRL/Palshikar_SAPDTS_2009.pdf)\]

### Dynamic Time Wrap

__What it can do__

  * Calculate similarity of two time series.

__Summary__

  * Get similarity of the whole time series, not subsequence.
  * Can take time series of different length (N, M).
  * Tolerate accelerations and decelerations, refer to [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping)
  * __Very costly__, cpu N*M, mem N*M. Cause R Studio to stuck
    * But, there exist __faster versions__. See [here](http://wenku.baidu.com/view/1ab54f360912a216147929dc.html).
  * Cannot tolerate that: one time series's Y value is shifted by C, or scaled by S
  * R package: "dtw"

__Theory__

For two points x and y, d(x, y) is a distance between the symbols, e.g. d(x, y) = \| x - y \|. Pseudo-code as below:

```
int DTWDistance(s: array [1..n], t: array [1..m]) {
    DTW := array [0..n, 0..m]

    for i := 1 to n
        DTW[i, 0] := infinity
    for i := 1 to m
        DTW[0, i] := infinity
    DTW[0, 0] := 0

    for i := 1 to n
        for j := 1 to m
            cost:= d(s[i], t[j])
            DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j  ],    // insertion
                                        DTW[i  , j-1],    // deletion
                                        DTW[i-1, j-1])    // match

    return DTW[n, m]
}
```

### Pearson Correlation

__What it can do__

  * Time series similarity

__Summary__

  * Fast, simple, widely used.
  * Tolerate Y axis shift or scaled.
  * R equipped in ccf()
  * Cannot tolerate that: time series A and B have different length.
      * You have to scale the X axis before hand (interpolation).
  * __Be careful with the Y=C case, or Y=X=C.__ See below chart.

__Theory__

Time series X=X(t), Y=Y(t). Think X, Y similar as Y=k*X+C. Then Y=Y(X) must be linear regressionable if they are similar. Pearson correlation is right what is used to determine linear relation fitness.

### Linear Segmentation

__What it can do__

  * Segment time-series into segments, separated by point of change.

__Summary__

  * In R package 'ifultools'.
  * Has really poor result, with or without noise.
  * Doesn't necessarily detect extreme points.
  * Piecewise linear segmentation of a time series
      * Cool method but why so bad result?
  * More segmentation methods can be found in __References__ below.

__Theory__

Use a sliding window of length n, each time move one point forward. If the least square regression of the window, has changed angle exceeding angle.tolerance, current point is marked as segmentation boundary.

### My Crafted Time-Series Segmentation

__What it can do__

  * Time-series segmentation
  * Provide basic pattern fragments for recognition

__Summary__

  * __FLAWS: when left/right regression walk across a maxima point, result is wrong__
  * Use linear regression on both side of a point to determine
  * Time complexity O(N*C), N is time series length, C is a constant.
  * Detects extreme points.
  * Better perform smoothing (FFT or others) before use this method.

__Theory__

Given a point, calculate the least square regression within K points of left side and right side, noted as Ll and Lr.

If the angles of Ll and Lr differs more than threshold G, current point is a segment boundary point.

neighbor_minima = function(x, k, t=0){
    res = c(1)
    for(i in 1:length(x)){
        l1 = max(1, i-k)

        r1 = min(i+1, length(x))
        r2 = min(i+k, length(x))
        lmean = mean(x[l1:l2])
        rmean = mean(x[r1:r2])
        cur = x[i]

        if(cur-lmean<t&&cur-rmean<t){
            res = append(res, i)
        }
    }
    res = append(res, length(x))

    merged = TRUE
    while(merged){
        merged = FALSE

        for(i in 1:(length(res))){
            if(i>=2&&res[i-1]-res[i]>-k){
                if(x[res[i-1]]<=x[res[i]]){
                    merged = TRUE
                    next

                    merged = TRUE
                    next
                }
            }
            res_merge = append(res_merge, res[i])
        }
        res = res_merge
    }

    res_merge
}

  * Could be slow/mem-consuming on large series.

__Theory__

  * I can use it to change irregular time interval to regular one
  * R way is cumbersome and fragile. I recommend __use Python__ to implement it.
      * Be careful with two NA point next to each other

__Theory__

Draw a straight line from NA point's left and right neighbor. NA point's y value is taken from the line.

R implementation seems to be cumbersome and fragile. I prefer to user Python to do it.

```
mdf=read.csv('~/Desktop/workspace/WLAP-cloud-intelligence/study/ceilometer_dump/2014-8-5/cpu_util.csv')
#mdf$time2 = as.POSIXct(mdf$time, origin="1970-01-01")  # get the time string from timestamp, the mdf$time is lost somehow
#x1=xts(mdf$value, mdf$time2)  # xts requires using Date for time, but zoo is enough

z1=zoo(mdf$value, mdf$time)
z2=zoo(NA, end(z1)+seq(-length(z1)+1, 0)*30)   # the empty "slots"
z3=merge(z2,z1)

#z4=na.locf(z3) # use value of prior point for NA
# use linear interpolation for NA, but this WON'T work if two NA next to each other
# this is really frigle. so, I'd better implement myself interpolation in python
z4=na.approx(z3[,2], na.rm=FALSE, rule=2)

z5=merge(z2, z4, all=FALSE)  # intersection of z2, z4
# z6 is the result
z6=z5[,2]
```

### Tip & Tricks

  * For smoothing, we usually iterate a smoothing algorithm multiple times (e.g. 3x), to achieve better effect.

  * "We might __subtract__ the trend pattern from the data values to get a better look at seasonality" in [here](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/?q=node/70)

  * Moving Average usually give middle point greater weight, in order to mitigate the smoothing effect.

  * Summarize of data smoothing techniques: [http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/ricard/Classes/KINE-5350/Data%20Smoothing%20and%20Filtering.ppt]

  * Selecting different MA order results in different trends obtained. "In particular, a 2×12-MA can be used to estimate the trend-cycle of monthly data and a 7-MA can be used to estimate the trend-cycle of daily data. Other choices for the order of the MA will usually result in trend-cycle estimates being contaminated by the seasonality in the data." (from [https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/2])
  
  * After the day/month seasonality is extracted, you can use STL on remainder, with very small seasonal window to extract remaining periodicity.
