1. Readings: Vision: Case Interview Secrets - Victor Cheng
   https://www.caseinterview.com/
   https://www.craftingcases.com/case-interview-examples/
    1. use proxy for estimation
        1. match you intuition and find proxy via
            1. relevance links
            2. history or similar peers
            3. population breakdown
        2. improving the proxy
            1. break the problem into different aspects and find multiple proxies
            2. finding different proxies from different layers for the same problem, and cross validate
            3. segmenting the proxy to confine the imperfect proxy issue
        3. comparing interview estimation problem vs real storage vision
            1. interview has limited time, no google, no knowledge background, no calculator. the general questions are general product-sales-revenue
            2. but targeting for storage area, we can borrow many knowledge, no time limit and use complex model and simulation, shadow peer works. so a lot questions become easier
    2. Consultant Sense
        1. Independent Problem Solver
            1. Can I drop you off with a division of a Fortune 500 company by yourself, with little to no supervision? Can you handle the client, solve the problems, and in the process make the firm looks good?
        2. Doing as Little as Possible vs Boiling the Ocean
            1. What is the "key information" to answer client's questions?
               How do the as little as possible to finish the quest?
        3. The Airplane Test (aka Don't Be an Asshole)
            1. Would I want to spend three hours sitting next to you on an airplane?
        4. Tooling
            1. Hypothesis
                1. Always Hypothesis first. Hypothesis dictate what customized Issue Tree you use
            2. Issue tree/framework/template
                1. Validated by
                    1. Always have Hypothesis first. Issue tree is dedicated to hypothesis, don't blindly borrow a framework for certain area
                    2. the MECE test
                    3. Victor Cheng's conclusiveness test: If all branches are true, you cannot reject the conclusion. To accept/reject the conclusion, you don't need less/more branches
            3. Drill-down analysis, goback and re-structure again
                1. process of elimination on false branches, until the final one left to point the true conclusion
            4. Synthesis: action-oriented, concise, big picture integrated with detailed analysis
    3. Issue tree frameworks
        1. Profitability framework: Revenue (price/#unit sold), (variable/fixed) cost
        2. Business situation framework: Customer, product, company, competition
        3. some tips
            1. Always do comparison, to historical data, to external competitors
            2. Company specific issue, or industry wide issue?
            3. Combine both qualitative questions and quantitative questions
            4. Segmentation and process-of-elimination
            5. Linear thinker, rationalize each decision choice taken, as be thoughtful
            6. P173 the live case Frameworks in action. This chapter is very good
    4. more captures
        1. Record and replay, until you get every wording synthesis right
        2. Brainstorm ideas but with structured categories heuristics, MECE mining, combination iteration
        3. Presentation slides: each title should give the point (rather than description), the all titles together should tell a complete story - synthesis

3. Taking Critical Thinking course
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/critical-thinking?u=3322
    1. Before rush to the problem at hand
        1. think what new problem will be introduced with your solving?
        2. are you SOLVING THE ROOT CAUSE OR THE SYMPTOM?
        3. Problem Statement
            1. define the goal, including what are the communication with Stakeholders, upstream, downstream
                1. go to the Stakeholder, and understand what they really care
            2. make sure whole team is on same page, rather than doing a lot of code in non-sync goals
            3. solve from different angels. find another group of people, explain the issue, and see how others define the problem
            4. Always start from having the goal first, rather than moving forward from what we have today by momentum.
                1. Do define the goal, you need Vision.
        4. DO SOLVE THE ROOT CAUSE. not only for code, also for the team and process issues
    2. Critical Thinking tools
        1. Challenge how business operates
            1. Business model blowup: HOW WOULD YOU DOUBLE YOUR TOP METRIC? WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY IF YOU STARTOVER?
            2. Revenue blowup: How would you triple profits in five years? Who is better at creating customer value?
            3. Cost blowup: How would you operate with two-thirds fewer people? How would you eliminate your job? What are the wasteful work you do?
        2. Five whys - reveals insights
            1. Example: Stock price hammered <- We missed our earnings <- We are discounting prices too much <- We want to retain customers <- We want to grow market share <- That's the incentive plan tied to managers and BU presidents, bigger share bigger bounds <- What if we change the incentive plan?
        3. The seven so-whats - thinking through consequences of an action
            1. Example: We will change incentive and bonus plan -> So what? If we change that, what happens?
               -> If we change it, we don't know how to fix it. We don't know how. If we knew how, we've already changed it.
               -> So what, what's the implication of that?
               -> We need to find someone who does know how to do it? -> So what -> That means we must hire a VP of Compensation
               -> So what -> We need to deprioritize other search for other hirings, so we can recruite this VP in
               -> So what -> We need to delay hiring a Supply Chain VP -> So what -> That means we must change supply chain goal of this year
            2. Ask "So what" for seven times, so we know what's the consequence.
               In the example, we start from incentive plan, we end up discover supply chain are impacted
        4. 80/20 rule - focus your effort on meaningful
            1. 20% input generates 80% results
               20% issues drives 80% complains
               focus your resource on the critical 20%
        5. How to successfully conduct analysis
            1. High road - don't boil the ocean, use 20/80 rule to skip if it doesn't worth lower level analysis
                1. What am I proving or disproving? Will it be beneficial? Will it have impact? Does the answer support my recommendation?
                2. * The "High Road / Low Road" essentially points out how a dev should balance the zoom-in and zoom-out during daily work
            2. Low road - only run analysis in the limited scope you need
                1. We can easily doing analyzing data for days or weeks, drilling too wide or too low. Don't do that
                2. Don't polish the dirt. You shouldn't get the refined the answer, if that refinement isn't going to add value.
                3. Focus your attention on the analytical problems that matter. Your time and your team's time are precious
                   Go back to the high road regularly, and ask the value for you analysis
                   Define the problem -> Generate recommendations -> Conduct analysis -> Determine if solution worked
            3. If problem solved, are there big enough impact to business?
               Also consider the connections of problems, which can reveal insight
               We are trying to figure out where to take business in the next 10 years? Products? Business? Markets? Acquisitions?

    3. Practice Critical Thinking
        1. Method 1: Teach your team to practice Critical Thinking.
                     To blowup the business, to scope the right problem.
                     To create environment and opportunities for team members to practice Critical Thinking
                     To coach people to use Critical Thinking
                     Hold people responsible to use Critical Thinking. Review and send them back if not. Every single day
            1. Ask: Why you necessary to do the analysis? How you did the analysis?
                    I want you to think about this. Come back this afternoon after you rethink

    4. Common pitfalls
        1. ask your stakeholder why he/she asks you to solve the problem.
           don't jump into the problem too quickly until you fully understand the problem
        2. unwilling to expand the problem space.
           use 5 whys to drill true related issues. filter with 80/20 rules.
           drill consequences / knock on effects after the recommendation (e.g. what happens after 6 months)
        3. taking the high road. look for reuse.
           what are the organization doing? what are our competitors doing?
        4. it's a red flag if you / your team answers with "that's how we do the things always"
           stop, step back, and apply Critical Thinking here

4. Taking Strategic Thinking course
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/strategic-thinking/practicality-get-real-about-your-strategy?autoplay=true&u=3322
    1. Beginning
        1. Questioning assumptions: why are we doing it that way? Interrogates habits, existing ways.
        2. Observing
           1. watch other people,
           2. macro-trends, big pictures and trends,
               1. Bad smell: surprised when something happened, which means you ommitted trends/micro-trends
                  You should NOT be surprised
            3. understanding the past
                1. Critical thinking to dig insights. don't stay on shadow surface answers
            4. system interactions, usecase scenarios,
            5. overlooked and unpopular points.
        3. Reflecting: to have a breakthrough idea, it doesn't take time, it takes space
        4. Strategic thinking means to think how to WIN THE GAME, not how to do tasks
           It begins with considering multiple parties, interact with stakeholder and competitor moves,
           rather than shut the door, and lock yourself into your own cares
           It's really the mindset that you have the strong will that you define where you goal, you take the actions to win it, and you never let other people lead you
        5. BEGIN WHEN HEAR WE DO/DIDN'T THIS BEFORE
            1. When you hear we always do it this way, or you hear we didn't do that before, it's the time to start strategic thinking
            2. Actually, everyone or team plan their daily work stemming from a baseline, the BASELINE IS WHAT "WE ALWAYS DO/DIDN'T DO THIS BEFORE". Essentially, everything needs to be re-examined, get out of habit.
    2. key mindsets 1
        1. Choose to do something, means NOT doing something else, that's a strategic choice
        2. You can be best at your task, but if your boss doesn't care about it, it's like not even happened
           Multiply chain: You time -> invested on your task -> your strategy -> difference in the organization
        3. Ask yourself: Where do I be in 3 or 5 years? Am I on track now? How can I increase my chances of success?
    3. key mindset 2
        1. Thinking from the long term down to the short term, from the big picture to the details, how you gonna get it completions
           Strategy is about the big picture choices you made, how you decide to go down. And especially, what you NOT going to do.
        2. Tactics. The clear and proactive actions. E.g. instead of read a book per week, use spent 10min read book on each morning train
           NOT may be I'll have time in another day. Instead, you know it's not gonna happen, Strategic thinking is about taking steps to make it happen.
        3. Free your attention
            1. Shutdown laptop, phone. Close all noise
               Tune out weekly. Sit with your thoughts, let your mind wander.
               Ask the big questions. Use blogging
               Protect your time. Management #1: You control your time.
               Cancel the many meetings. Create a weekly blocker
    4. How to create an informed strategy?
        1. good strategy doesn't need to be innovative. it's about making decision
        2. consider the trends in industry. what can be next breakthrough be?
            1. it recalls me about the issue tree in "Case Interview Secrets" - Business situation framework: Customer, product, company, competition
        3. make sure to solicit input from diverse sources. including yourself and others.
            1. what are people in your orbit won't probably weight in
            2. new voices and new perspectives mitigate risks
        4. Map out your assets and allies, your relationships, e.g. boss, friends providing help
           Map out your constraints, e.g. structural obstacles,
                e.g. VP wants to install his/her own guy in Latin America, therefore block you
                e.g. You work in a vertical, that's never historical been a path to international career
                e.g. Cultural. Your company values experience and longevity. Hardly get your idea heard when you only been their couple of years.
           Land them on axis, make strategies and tactics. They key is Realistic and attainable
           1. I think this is SWOT typically.
    5. How to buy support from boss, colleagues, your employees
        1. If you are developing a strategy, don't unveil it at the strategy meeting. The meeting is supposed to be a ratification meeting. Real work takes place beforehand
           Systematically briefing key people, addressing any concerns they might have upfront.
           Don't give chance on meeting questions are asked that you haven't fought through
        2. Prepare to face objections
           Setup a brainstorm to collect 80% of what kind of objections that people can throw on you. Never go unprepared
           Prepare to face objectors, e.g. market product seizes part of sales people's work
           If you are aware that's coming your way, you can make other concessions that would soften the blow or make the arrangement more palatable
           1. Remember the negotiation courses, BATNA
        3. Create systems for accountability
           E.g. emails after meeting to recap action steps and agreements. E.g. to frequently reiterating what your timeline is, what marks are on the path.
           Ensure there is no slippage along the way. You need to bring your team onboard
    6. Measure the strategy execution progress in a changing circumstances
        1. Identify the assumptions. Be quantify what your success should be look like. Verify assumption upfront
           Evaluate your progress a regular intervals. Be adaptive to changing. Verify progress against your assumptions. The key is identifying in advance.
           10,000 hours fame, deliberate study from where our assumptions were verified wrong
        2. Key mindset
           1. Upfront, retro verify, execute risk part with more frequency, small probe prototype tests
           2. Learn and deliberately practice at where you failed.
        3. Questions to audit your strategy
           1. Are you failing to meet initial expectations?
           2. Has there been a major change in circumstances?
        3. Is there a more promising alternative?

5. Decision making strategies
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/decision-making-strategies/accelerate-your-decision-making?autoplay=true&u=3322
   1. Decision making is a process, rather than judgement
      1. define the objective
          1. clear objective, define the timeline, define who will be affected
          2. explore alternatives
      2. define who to involve, and how to involve (make decision, data providing)
         1. decision making style: autocratic style, participatory style, democratic style, consensus based style
            1. driven by urgency and impact size of the decision
         2. stakeholder management
            1. meeting should be for process approval, rather than arguing.
               major work should be done before meeting that have already reached consensus with each stakeholder.
            2. let stakeholder know what's the benefit to participant in the meeting
               know/define the role of each stakeholder
               goals: identify risk earlier, get support earlier, find opportunities earlier
            4. RACI matrix
               1. Responsible - one person to deliver the project and execute
               2. Accountable - approves the project. make sure stakeholders are involved properly, get the results as expected
               3. Consulted - seek opinions and information. the communication is two way, R needs to provide info first
               4. Informed - need to keep update to the progress.
      3. reduce ambiguity risk
         1. Categories
            1. highly predictable
               1. How will customer receive the changes
                  How many to buy
            2. distinct Possibilities
               1. Parity A or Parity B gets elected, favorable or unfavorable regulation to make
               2. Reduce Ambiguity: Market research, replace product to suffer less political issues
                  1. Build contingency plan, for each possible outcomes
            3. spectrum of outcomes
               1. gather information from multiple sources to reduce ambiguity
                  the value of additional information is high and worth investment
            4. complete unpredictability
               1. gather additional data, construct possible scenarios
               2. Phased decision-making, breakdown big decision into smaller ones to reduce risk
               3. Reduce ambiguity
                  1. Run a pilot
                  2. Conversation with regulators
                  3. Analyze competitors, reactions in the past
                  4. review economics forecasts
      4. make a choice, make it known to the organization
         1. types of decisions made
            1. No downside
            2. Favorable odds - mostly well, but small possibility to go bad
            3. Going for broke - uncertain, bad outcome is unbearable
               1. need to reduce risk as much as you can, run pilot, gather information
         2. methods to reduce ambiguity
            1. involve more people, involve early
            2. take more time. a month, or even a year, you'll have more info and support
            3. break big decision into smaller ones
            4. find the balance of getting more information vs new uncertain injected with time
         3. critical questions to ask yourself
            1. How big is the decision? Can I break it into smaller ones to reduce risk?
            2. How irrevocable is the decision? Is rollback expensive?
            3. What's the cost of being wrong? What's the value of being right? Trade off
            4. How long do you have to make the decision? What's the real deadline?
            5. What's the cost of waiting? What's the value of making now? Trade off
            6. What is my personal biases that might be affecting the decision?
            7. How do I mitigate the biases to make clearer decisions?
            8. Who do I need to involve in decision? How do I involve them?
            9. Who needs to know the decision made? How should I inform them? Communication plan
      5. evaluate the decision, it's a feedback loop, measure and improve
         1. communicating, executing, and measuring
            1. Communicate
               1. what the decision is, who made the decision, why the decision was made
               2. what the goal is, how success will be measured, events that lead to a reversal
            2. execution risks
               1. passive aggressive behavior
               2. new information, new events
            3. measure and adjust
               1. set clear metrics
               2. resolve sources of uncertainty
               3. measure and adjust, be willing to say we made an incorrect decision and we need a different path

        1. Setting the bar, and more importantly holding the bar when your team member tries to drift it.
            1. Make sure your team member is delivering the same quality results as if you were doing it by yourselves
            2. Get results with high quality whenever they are being reviewed by the next level manager.
        2. Manager works by investment. IC works by work.

5. Develop Your Coaching Skills as a Leader or Manager - Coaching and Developing Employees - Lisa Gates
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/coaching-and-developing-employees-5/cornerstones-of-coaching-15230019
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/develop-your-coaching-skills-as-a-leader-or-manager
    0. good training. very useful.
    1. Coaching overview
        1. Coaching is not hand-holding or tell people what to do step by step. It's guiding, questioning, prompting and encouraging people forward movement. Inspire people to take ownership of their work and careers.
        2. Establish a coaching relationship
            1. People can be desperate trying to do more impact, or disengaged that you need to push to move forward.
            2. GROW framework: Goals, Realities (challenges and road blockers), Options (alternatives available to goals), Way forward (choosing the next step, accountability, timing and deadline).
                1. Goals: What would you like to achieve? Where would you want to go in the road of your career.
                2. Reality: What are the obstacles in the middle of achieving your goal?
                3. Options: What are all the possibilities?
                4. Way forward: What are your next steps? (Accountability)
            3. Step 2: Make coaching over ongoing conversations and agree on basic logistics. Logistics include time your need, how often, and location. Build trust along the way.
            4. Others
                1. Ask what motivates your employee
                    1. link the purpose with organization's
                    2. so, another part of Manager's role is: VISION and MOTIVATING

        4. Cornerstones of coaching.
            1. CURIOSITY. Cassidy performance is off. Be open to ask the question why Cassidy's performance is off.
                1. Rather than pressure the pressure, be curious to ask and learn about how people feel and think, build the trust corner stone
                2. CONVERSATION - it means to interactive, let employee talk and lead.
            2. Let the employee lead. Ask open questions. Employee often knows exactly the things that go off rails. We don't step in the middle of the way. get out of the way.
            3. Coach the whole person.
            4. Example conversation
                1. "Cassidy, you are the really talented people here. Help me understand, what's really happening here?"
                   "You are always well-organized, Cassidy. Tell me what changed here?"
                   Cassidy: "I was preparing my PMP exam. And with all that construction on the bridge, my commute was twice as long."
                   "I'm so sorry about that, and I totally understand the stress you're under."
                   "Let me ask you this. What kind of magic wand would solve things for you?"
                   Cassidy: "I'd like to ask that. I'd like Lindy to share the team responsibility with me."
                   "Say more about that."
                2. Key points:
                    1. CREATE SPACE FOR CONVERSATION. (avoid -> conversation -> collaboration)
                       Let Cassidy lead.
                       Be curious to learn the problem, rather than telling Cassidy to leave the problem at home.

        5. Three types of coaching conversations
            1. Vision Conversations: Typically happening at the beginning of the coaching arc. To review people's accomplishments, repeat themes, what inspire them, what they want to learn, and how they see their career unfolding.
                1. Example - check-in
                    1. "I'm glad, Cassidy, we're on the same page, you know? I'm impressed."
                       "Look, one of your biggest goals this year is to excel as a team lead. And then move on to directing a development group, right?"
                       "So, what strength do you think you already have that you can lean on to accomplish that"
                       Cassidy: "I think I'm great at translating our bigger organization goals into actionable chunks."
                       "I can see that. What else?"
                       Cassidy: "I'm also really good at understanding each of my team member's unique strengths. And how to match those strength to the needs of any give project."
                       "And that is where you really shine, Cassidy."
                       "So what trips you up? What do you think you need to learn?"
                       Cassidy: "I'll be getting a better job for delegating for sure."
                       "And, what would that look like?"
                    2. Key points:
                        1. Stay open.
                           Keep drilling down your people's answers.
                           To make sure you are not just skimming the surface, or moving to the goal setting process too quickly.
                        2. Spend time in this arc, so that the goals your people set are energizing, and connected to both their personal aspirations, and the needs of your company.
                    3. Power Tips for digging deeper
                        1. Keep asking open ended questions. "AND WHAT ELSE?"
            2. Implementation Conversations: Help people translate self-awareness and visioning into setting goals and accountabilities.
                1. Example
                    1. "What do you need to be delegating with more consistency?"
                       Cassidy: "If I were to do what you're doing with me now, asking questions and getting deeper knowledge about what people need and want, I think I'd be able to trust myself to let go, and give them more autonomy."
                       "Cassidy, that's a great insight you know."
                       "And, what does that look like as a concrete next step?"
                       Cassidy: "Well, I think having some individual conversations first, and then, at our next team meeting, I'll make sure we are all clear about the next quarter goals, make assignments from there."
                       "Hey, what if you let everyone make their own assignments?"
                       Cassidy: "Right, thank you. Actually, that's a great idea."
                       "Do you think you can handle that in our next meeting?"
                       Cassidy: "Year, year, I can."
                    2. Key points
                        1. specificity, next action steps.
            3. Reflection Conversations: Create a pause in the action to anchor learning, growth, and results. You're accessing, acknowledging, and maybe even celebrating.
                1. "So, tell me, what made your delegating adventure so successful?"
                   Cassidy: "It probably sounds crazy, but every time I had the impulse to give direction, I just held my tongue for five seconds."
                   "And, what is the impact of that great idea?"
                   Cassidy: "They all have their problems solved on their own. I barely had to say anything. I can't believe it's that simple."
                2. Power Tips
                    1. See Cassidy. "Wait five seconds"

    3. Coaching skill building
        1. Ask open ended questions which are powerful
        2. Become an active listener
        3. Challenging your employee for growth
            1. You could say all of coaching is about challenge, helping people stretch beyond current capacity
            2. key points
                1. Get out of your comfortable zone
                2. Brainstorm to find the best challenge
                3. Make sure your employee ACCEPT the challenge
            Example
                Cassidy is having delegation issues and feel frustrated
                Cassidy: I want to hire Sam ... He has good XX skill.
                I'm so sorry, but given our budget, I can't assure you anything.
                What if you teach, they got learned (delegation).
                Cassidy: I just got my life ordered. You ask me to take on more?
                Sounds like you are between a choice of do it your own or just let it go. What's the leadership choice, Cassidy?
                Cassidy: I don't know
                These workflow changes can make our employee grow immensely. What if you delegate more, so they can teach what they have learned, and get things implemented?
                Cassidy: I think I got it. I can ask Lora to lead the project meeting. While I put a workshop together.
                And how do you think Lora will feel about it?
                Cassidy: She'll love it. She's great at it.
                And, what are your learning from all the things Cassidy?
                Cassidy: I guess I can skip the whining and go straight to delegating.

        4. Taking the next step and build momentum
            1. Pre-brainstorming questions
                1. What are you frustrated about?
                2. What do you want?
                3. What are your aspirations?
            2. Powerful questions to get employee out of stuck
                1. Generators
                    1. What you have tried already?
                    2. What part of the problem have you not explored?
                    3. What needs to be happening and it's not happening now?
                    4. What would it look like if everything is exactly you envisioned?
                    5. What are the other option?
                    6. What else?
                2. Deciders
                    1. What's the smallest and easiest step you can take right now?
                    2. What action you would like to take to fire the project?
                    3. What would give you the biggest leap?
                    4. What is the one action that will trigger all the rest?

        5. Managing the accountability
            1. What agreement your employee has made to do? When will they do it? How do you know it's done?
            2. Failing and miss the deadline is the opportunity to learn and growth
            3. Example:
                Cassidy: ... Complaining about issues ....
                Looking at what they ..., what do you want to do for the issue?
                Cassidy: I want to say (instead of complaining to me), what are your solution then?
                Moving to delegation ... what if, the team comes to a better plan, than your original proposal?
                Sounds like, you are going to delegate this to your team. Therefore, what kind of accountability can we setup?
                Accountability: Ask for a deadline and deliverables.

        6. Giving future-focused feedback
            1. Momentum: make people encouraged, rather than frustrated, get accomplishment, and positive loop
            2. Facing disappointment, failures, missed deadlines. Focus on what's possible and improvements.
            3. Future-focused Questions

        3. Avoid new manager to become the bottleneck of their team
            1. Teach the business to run itself.
            2. Identify what is you and only you can do. How can you drop or delegate the rest?
               How can you encourage your team to step up, and proactively suggest solutions?
            3. Delegate each of: Tiny, Tedious, Time-consuming, Terrible at, Teachable
               What's left - the most strategic tasks: $10 tasks, $100, $1000, and $10000 tasks
        4. Stay connected beyond the new manager's transition
            1. 1-on-1 meeting.
            2. Reflect together at 1-year period

            5. Interview the new hire: what will be helpful in the next 90 days?
        2. Create a context for coaching
            1. Check in weekly. Set expectation and thought outputs. Ask exploratory questions. Reflect together what's going well or need help
        3. Quick wins: Empower your new hire to make an impact
            1. Set a few small win tasks for the new hire. After 90 days, should be able to set vision for 1 year
    2. Connect and engage with a Pivot Plan
        1. Plant Stage: Strength, one year vision.
            1. Strength: What they were thankful on and succeeded on? What were their go-to-person on their previous team?
            2. Vision: 90 days, 1 year.
        2. Scan Stage: People, Skills, Projects
            1. Assign your new hire a buddy.

            2. 3Es for a successful pilot: Do you enjoy it? Can you become expert on it? Does it have room to expand?
        4. Launch Stage: Powerful questions to wrap new hire onboarding
            1. Big L: Going on in end of the new hire period. Ready for full capacity. No more hands on. Noogler Orientation
            2. Little L: Per conversion. What's insight of the conversation. What the next actions, and how do I know.
    3. Checking in: Keeping an Open Line of Communication
        1. Not problem solving. Instead, use open questions to guide career conversations
            1. "Tell me more", "What's exciting about that", "What else", "What's important in that", "What would success look like in that"
            2. Less you talk, more output. Keep unveil their strengths and aspirations.
        2. Encourage transparency, encourage talking about failings, and what is learned. Encourage what's going wrong
            1. Celebrate mistakes. Physiological safety
        3. Avoid three common coaching mistakes
            1. Mistake: Providing too many answers

                   Ask "What do you propose here", "What you see Pros and Cons in this approach"
            2. Mistake: Missing opportunities to follow up
                1. Consider the tone and energy level of the new hire.
                   "When you say that, I saw your whole face light up", "Your tone of voice changed completely", "What's exciting about that"
                   "What your gut say"
            3. Mistake: Too much intellectualizing
                1. Having them get lost in "shoulds" and or what I call the beehive of the brain
                2. As a Manager, you can bring team members out of their head and into their whole-body intelligence systems

                    2. Set challenging goals
                    3. Align goals with the organization

               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/coaching-for-results/how-to-coach-a-careerist-16132040?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5c926f1c498e2e8c8a2050ad&resume=false&u=3322
                1. Dip is expected in coaching, as coachee is being challenged. Help people move from dip to actions

    4. Coaching Low Performers
        1. Guidelines
            1. Everyone will have performance challenges during their career including you.

            2. What are the facts?
               What is the impact?
               What changes must be made?
            3. Guidelines
                1. Set a meeting
                2. Share your observations. Facts, and numbers
                3. Ask for input for your observations.

                10. Create a follow-up structure

        4. How to coach a low performer
            1. Example: CJ & Sam - useful. It tells how to use the above steps
               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/coaching-for-results/how-to-coach-a-low-performer-16133827?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5c926f1c498e2e8c8a2050ad&resume=false&u=3322
                1. Rather than saying you have bad performance, say the numbers - BEGIN THE PROBLEM BY FACTS AND NUMBERS, rather than vague criticisms
                2. Setup context and expectation about this meeting
                3. Before go on, CONFIRM WITH COACHEE how he/she thinks about the numbers
                    1. This is another key point of what CONVERSATION means - rather than you talk, let the partner ACCEPT what you deliver
                4. So here is the problem .. coach try summarize reflect to make sure understanding
                   Then, ask "what else", the powerful question
                5. Where come your frustration?
                6. What takes you to deal with that frustration around?
                7. Drilling down the problem. Ask the employee to lead. It really revealed the true problem underlyingly inside the team.
                   OK .. the team is throwing all bad angry cases to Sam. Documentation is garbage.
                8. Ask what the employee think about how to fix the problem.
                9. Coach reply: OK .. I'll commit to research and investigating, your ideas and your concerns to find a solution
                   In the meantime, what strategies can we come up to help you deal with customers more positively and effectively?
                   Coach: What's in your mind? Encourage the employee to say
                    1. Sam: I'll rewrite the documentation and script. I want to train people. I'd be good at it.
                    2. Coach: I'm so pleased. So let's get more specific on how you can own it in your current role first.
                10. Coach: What adjectives you want to supervise calls to hear? - Let the coachee say the expectation of a good case
                11. Coach: Recap the goal of the conversation here. What action would you take to get up your numbers by the end of the month?
                    1. Coach: What action else do you need to take? ...
                    2. Mentoring train .. Sam: I'm afraid people don't like me much. Coach: That's right the reason you should try a shot
                11. Setup the logistics. Coach: I'll setup the next meeting. In the meantime, we should meet weekly. Get coaching and follow up conversations.
                    Coaching is not for mis-behaved children. It's for talented adults who aspire to something.
                12. Coach: So .. why don't you send me an email to recap everything we agreed to?

                n. good .. if you compare this example with the other "CJ & Sam" examples before. This is very good learning example.

        5. Challenges to coaching high performers
            1. Traits of high performers
                1. Positive characteristics
                    1. Confident.
                    2. Self-directed.
                    3. Crave autonomy
                    4. loathe failure
                    5. Constantly trying to improve the game
                2. Negative ones
                    1. Aggressive
                    2. Arrogant
                    3. Selfish
                    4. Inflated sense of skills
            2. Stay in peer relation, equal position.
               Make real challenging goals.
               Review frequently and adapt the strategies.
               Focus on relationships as much as goals
               Help them build positive influence in peers
               Help them find the people to coach. Grow their leadership skills, and the coaching culture in organization.
               Stay in the high-support, high-challenge zone.
               Praise them. Don't skim just because they are high performer.
               Get out of them way. Don't micromanaging.
            3. Example CJ & Maren, a senior sales manager with several reports
               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/coaching-for-results/how-to-coach-a-high-performer-15024932?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5c926f1c498e2e8c8a2050ad&resume=false&u=3322
                1. CJ: So can I share what I noticed? When you are problem solving for others, you are queued up to the big picture, and you are clear and directed. When you are solving problems for yourself, you get small and tend to point fingers. So how you can map problem solving for yourself to the big picture?
                2. CJ was persistent, and didn't get detoured by Maren's frustration and emotion. And CJ didn't take sides with her and demonize Charlie.
                3. Coaching with difficult relationships. Remember you are not coaching the persons that's not in the room, even that person is 100% at fault, you always want to focus on your coachee

    5. Practice your coaching skill in day-to-day conversations, rather than just 1-on-1 conversation.

        3. We think at ~3000 words/min, we listen at ~300 words/min, we speak at ~200 words/min.
           People talk more when they feel being heard. Shut up an listen in a sale conversation
        4. Listen and think what's your connection to the other person, the connection to the purpose, and the world
            "Bring the truth", "Show what's integrity", "Unlock your potential"
            "What are the most proud moments in your life", "What are the most significant experiences", "What are the things that piss you off the most"
    4. Ask Powerful Questions
        1. Braining has a lot of bias. Confirm your assumptions before move. Children/New Hires can ask Powerful Questions because they don't yet have these assumptions
        2. Instead of asking Why, ask What or How. "Why" tends to make people defensive. Ask open questions.
    5. Create physiological safety
        1. Create expectation, how each member in team should work
        2. Feedback is a gift (whether they see it now, or after 10 years). If you don't give feedback, you are not serving them.

    n. My questions
        1. So, A core part of Manager is SKILLED LISTENTING.
           That's why we need to attend every meeting, listen and give impactful feedback.
           That explains why I was suggested to attend the meeting with full attention and listen carefully.

    1. Goal: From conflict to collaboration
    2. Anatomy of Conflict
        1. When conflict erupts
            1. When believed to be deprived of something
                1. Name - Blame - Claim cycle
                    1. Name: What is being deprived of
                    2. Blame: Who is doing depriving
                    3. Claim: What social norm is it breaking
            2. Conflict against social norm

        2. Thomas-Kilman Conflict Model - Conflicting styles
            1. 4 Quadrant: Avoid - Compete - Collaborate - Accommodate - Compromise (Conflicting Styles)
                1. I win or lose, you win or lose. -> double win
                2. Some choose to argue to exhaustion. Some choose to wait out of the storm
            2. Contentious Tactics
                1. sweet talk, promises, mutual gain, persuasive argumentation, shaming, threats, physical forces
                2. start listening for Contentious Tactics, pause, and drill deeper
                3. Why is a logical argument often contentious? - The premises may not be acceptable to all parties.
            3. Unwinding cognitive bias
                1. Hindsight bias: "I know it all along"
                2. Fundamental attribution error: get to conclusion before knowing the facts
                3. Confirmation bias: look to interpret information to match our bias
                4. Belief bias: believing more is better, then any favor in quality over quantity is rejected

        3. Conflict resolving framework - The Resolution Roadmap
            1. Identify issues and needs
                1. Think of a situation and ask: Relational? Substantive (About content or process)? Perceptual?
                    1. Investigate my own needs and behaviors
                        1. What do my actions and behaviors demonstrate about what I want?
                        2. How would I behave if I was really committed to what I want?
                    2. Investigate others needs and behaviors
            2. Distinguishing fact from fiction
                1. Blame cycle: Something happened -> Feeling -> Stories -> Action -> Argument
                2. Investigate your "stories" and find what else can be true
            3. Opening the conflict conversation - Move from avoidance to conversation
                1. A successful opening
                    1. State the facts as you see them
                    2. Tell your story and own it as story
                    3. Ask your conflict partner for their perspectives
                2. Example Gina & William
                    1. Don't let the conflict partner's emotion to trigger you
                    2. Acknowledge the emotion but drill down
            4. Gaining alignment and brainstorming
                1. Ask the big deal questions - What are we committed to? Or what goal are we all try to accomplish?
                    1. The idea is find the common stand ground for both sides
                2. Example Gina & William
                   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/conflict-resolution-foundations-4/gaining-alignment-and-brainstorming?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
                    1. By finding the shared ground, alignment, the conflict partner is instead offering help. New solutions are found
            5. Getting to agreement
                2. Example Gina & William
                   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/conflict-resolution-foundations-4/getting-to-agreement?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
                    1. Work out the accountability
                    2. Acknowledge the achievement of the conflict partner

        4. Deepening Conflict Resolution Skills
            1. Increasing your conflict capacity
                1. What's your trigger? How triggered or upset were you? What's the feeling level?
                   Conflict Resolution is a self discipline. It's never about the other person, even it is.
                2. Partner training
            2. Asking DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
                1. Wrong: Do you want to talk about the meeting?
                   Diagnostic: What are your thoughts about how the meeting went?
                2. Example Gina & William
                    1. What does alignment mean to you?
            3. Tactic Listening Skills
                1. Three levels of listening
                    1. See before
                2. Example Gina & William
                    1. body language
                    2. get eye contact
                    3. reflect what you hear
                        1. "What I'm hearing is", "It sounds like"
                3. Tactical Listening Skills
                    1. Labeling
                        1. Example Gina & William
                            1. "And it seems you are worried about .. and .."
                        3. Labeling means to reframe the conversation that allow them to noodle on possible conversations
                    2. Mirroring
                        1. Useful when you feel confused or triggered. Use Mirroring to defuse conflict
                        2. To repeat the last a few words or critical words of your conflict partner's language
                            1. Fighting words
                        3. Example Gina & William
                            1. "Well, here's the issue I see them. For the last nine month ..."
                            2. "I, you, we, whatever"
                    3. Silence
                        1. Used when you have no idea what to say, or the conflict partner said something so out of bound that you need to take the temperature down
                        2. Example Gina & William
                           https://www.linkedin.com/learning/conflict-resolution-foundations-4/labeling-mirroring-and-silence?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
                            1. "I'm irritable and I'm in a hurry. Is there anything else"
                               "Yes. Your full attention. Or we will have a full mutiny"
                4. Reframing
                    1. Asking questions helps you understand your conflict partner's interests and goals.
                       Paraphrasing helps you double-check your understanding.
                       Mirroring helps you signal to your conflict partner that what they've said is potentially disruptive and subtly invites them to explain themselves or move from competition to collaboration.
                       And labeling helps you build tactical empathy by reframing the feeling or need of the other person.
                    2. To let them know you understand them, and help them move to a more movable role

16. Negotiation Foundations - Lisa Gates (Project and Management)
    https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-foundations/negotiate-with-better-results?autoplay=true&u=3322
    1. Negotiation with better results
    2. The basics of Negotiation
        1. Mindset
            1. Interested-base negotiation: Discovery of both parties for needs and preferences
            2. First it's conversation, next reach agreement, requires curiosity and creativity
        2. Three core negotiation practices
            1. Needs to be slow and relational, instead of fast and transactional
            2. Check in your conservation partner to make sure full attention, and fully connected
            3. Ask DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS: open questions to discover interests
            4. No is the beginning of negotiation
        3. Anchoring and framing for mutual benefit
            1. Anchoring: Landing your request and preferences
               Framing: View the problem in new perspectives
        4. Tactical Listening
            1. Labeling - reframe the true needs of the conservation partner
            2. Mirroring - a subtle challenge
            3. Silence
        5. Trading things of value
            1. Prepare options
                -> Small talks and opening -> Ensure attention
                -> Diagnostic Questions to discover boss's thinking
                -> Anchor
                -> Frame
                -> Labeling/Mirroring/Silence
                -> Trading things of value
                -> Agreement
        6. The wrong and right way to negotiate
            1. Example: Joe & Adriana
               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-foundations/the-wrong-and-right-way-to-negotiate-18022249?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
                1. Useful. Comparing the good and bad example
                2. Session 1: Joe's Mistakes
                    1. Speeding through his proposal, even Adriana is clearly occupied
                    2. Defending his idea, rather than be curious about Adriana's concern
                3. Session 2: Joe's correct doings
                    1. Engage with small talks. Check if time is right. Ensure full attention
                    2. Slow down the proposal. Make sure message received
                    3. Asking a Diagnostic Question to allow Adriana to voice her concern, after Joe has framed his proposal
                    4. Labeling - "So, sounds like revenue is a big concern"
                    5. Incorporate Adriana's concern into a new possibility - "So with revenue in mind, I interviewed a few conference directors that have been super successful with this format and they said sponsors are knocking down the doors to participate. - I'd love to see that happen. - Well, listen, if you don't think it's in the cards for this year, we can point to next year for sure. But right now I just wanted to get you excited about what's possible. Now what I'd like to do is go over some of the research with you and I can show you the revised draft I came up with so you can make an informed decision. What are your thoughts on that?"
                        1. Joe let Adriana has a control of timing and make changes.
                           Joe reframed the request from "you got to do this now" to "Let's just take a look at how it might work"
                           Joe finished with a question to make Adriana engaged and in problem solving mode
                        2. Change your approach FROM TRANSACTIONAL TO RELATIONAL. Slow things down, get connected.
                           Make space for objection and pushback

    3. Getting ready for a Negotiation
        1. Researching and preparing
            1. Define what you want.
            2. Research. Find market or stakeholder expectations.
            3. Write an open statement
            4. List potential pushbacks
        2. Identifying priorities and designing options
            1. What are your priorities?
            2. What is the benefit to your conversation partner?
            3. What is the cost or impact for your request?

    4. Engaging you allies
        1. Understanding how influence works
            1. Six Principles of Influence
                1. Reciprocity: Responding to a positive action with a positive action
                2. Consistency: Do what you said you are going to do
                3. Confirming to custom or group behavior
                4. Liking: Being influenced by who are similar to us
                5. Authority: Obeying or believing people in position or power
                6. Scarcity: Having a limited supply will create demand
        2. Creating your influence plan
            1. How can you stay happen/engaged in your career in the next 3 years?
               What are your top three goals?
               What's the learning resources do you need to accomplish your goal?
               What relationship do you need on your radar?
            2. Take time to continuously foster your relationships

    5. Getting through and past no
        1. Understanding conflict styles
            1. 4 Quadrant: Avoid - Compete - Collaborate - Accommodate - Compromise (Conflicting Styles)
            2. Labeling, Mirroring, Silence
            3. Consider maintaining Relationship
        2. A template for getting past no
            1. So "no" begins negotiation -> Diagnostic Questions -> Anchoring the reason -> Labels and Mirrors -> Reframes
            2. Example: Joe & Adriana
                1. Diagnostic Questions, Label the concerns, Align and collaborate
                2. SAYING/HEARING NO IS THE BEGINNING OF NEGOTIATION
        3. A template for saying no (Chris Voss' "Never Split the Difference)
            1. 8 Ways to say NO
                1. The curious no - "How am I supposed to do that?"
                2. The helpful no - "I love that you thought of me and I'm unable to participate. I'd be glad to help you find someone else."
                3. The appreciate no - "I think your idea is fabulous, and I'm not able to participate at this time."
                4. The no with a possible future yes - "Yeah, I'd love to participate, but at a later date. Can you ask me again in January?"
                5. The no with a specific future yes - "I'd love to help you with your project and I'm on deadline until Tuesday. Can we talk on Wednesday?"
                6. The no when you don't know - "It sounds interesting, but I need to sleep on that.", "I need to check with my boss or partner."
                7. The no with values - "If I take on another task right now, I wouldn't be honoring my productivity commitment to my current project team."
                8. The positive no - "Yeah, I'd love to participate and I'm going to have to decline."

    6. Essential negotiation tips and strategies
        1. Dealing with contentious tactics
            1. Identifying Contentious Tactics
                1. Ingratiation - "Hey, you're so skilled and fast with spreadsheets, and I'd love your help setting one up for me."
                2. Promises - "If you run the meeting again for me today, I'll cover for you anytime you want to take a day off."
                3. Shaming - "Your work is pretty subpar so far, and it really doesn't represent company standards."
                4. Persuasive - "All the data shows that people aren't buying trucks, and I'd like to get your ideas about why that's happening."
                5. Threats - "If you can't keep up and meet deadlines, your days are numbered."
            2. Identify Contentious Tactics so you can disengage/attack-back and lead the conversation toward collaboration
                1. Labeling, Mirroring, Silence
                2. Diagnostic Questions

            3. Bring warmth, e.g. food, drink
            4. Express your disappointment. Ouch, Flinch
                1. Diagnostic Questions: "What is about my experience, strengths and accomplishments that isn't worth $90,000?"
                    1. So, besides using TRADABLES in negotiation, another way to stop the attack or throw it back is to use DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS. It also forces the opponent to reveal its opening offer.
            5. Anchor with a specific number of give a range

    7. Negotiating at a distance
        1. Telephone and video conference negotiation
            1. Make up for the loss of visual cues

            2. F2F is still better anyway. Then phone.


15. Negotiation Skills - Chris Croft (For Sales and Buyers)
    https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-skills/everyone-needs-to-negotiate?autoplay=true&u=3322
    1. Everyone needs to negotiate. Good lecture.
    2. Decide to Negotiate
        1. Identify your reasons for avoiding negotiation
            1. Cultural. Embarrassing. Acting bad.
                1. You can be negotiating and still be liked
            2. Seem unstructured: You don't know what the other person will do
            3. Everything is negotiable, even "Do I have time today?" Even the course here.
        2. Overcome embarrassment and pride to negotiate
            1. "My father has to pay the full price of the car, because his pride avoided negotiation"
                1. Instead, even we win only half of the deal, we still save price
                    1. Save $1000 in 15min from the car
                2. How to deal with the humiliation?
                    1. Detach from it, and think it as a game
                    2. When the money is large, you are playing a chess game for your organization
            2. Negotiate without lying
                1. You shouldn't lie
                    1. Don't lie about numbers or facts. You don't know how much they know. You may find it out afterward.
                       Body language may also give you away. More, it becomes more difficult to maneuver
                2. Fine to not telling the other person truth or everything
                    1. It's fine and essential to learn to be good at being evasive
                    2. Especially when they position themselves as your friend, or joint problem solving partner
                       "let's share all our information, and work out the best deal for both of us"
                       Be careful
                3. To be polity evasive
                    1. Use feelings - "I'm just not happy to pay that much"
                    2. "I don't know" - "I don't have the cost information. We don't break it down that way"
                    3. "I'm not allowed to say" - "It's not our policy to reveal costs"
                    4. "You don't think I'm going to tell you that, do you?"
                    5. "It depends ..." -
                        "It depends how many you want to buy. Do you have a quantity in mind?"
                        "We have find out ... many complications .. that's expensive .. off we go"
                        1. bounce the question back to them, ask info first
            3. Stop your fear of losing the deal
                1. Reasons to try negotiating
                    1. You may get a better deal
                    2. You won't lose the starting offer
                2. You walk away and wishing they call you back
                    1. If they don't - "Great news, I just talked to our boss/bank, and I can afford your price."
                3. Losing it by them walking away and throw you out?
                    1. This won't happen, if you always make sure you are nice
                        1. Key is: Blame it on yourself
                            Instead of saying "your price is high", say "This is more than I can afford"
                            or "You boss will be really unhappy if I spend that much"
                    2. Reel them back in if necessary
                        1. "Well .. I'm sure we can find a deal somehow"
                           "We've got this far, we've nearly reached an agreement. Maybe, we can think it in a different way"
                        2. Be ready to be crumbling
            4. Instead of yes or no, negotiate
                1. Yes -> Negotiate <- No. There is a distance in between
                2. Instead of saying No, there is price of not doing. Use that in negotiation
            5. Spot seven signs that you should negotiate
                1. "How about offer you 10% off?" - This is a strong sign of negotiate. You can say "I'll buy it if 20% off"
                2. The item is on sale
                3. The manager is present
                4. You're not enthusiastic
                5. You have other options
                6. You're the seller and the customer wants something more
                7. You have a compliant

    3. Planning Your Negotiation
        1. Set your walk-away number and never exceed it - The hard reject policy
            1. The source power of negotiation is able to walk away
                1. This is why walk-away number is so important
            2. Don't sell/buy something if it's less worthy to you
            3. Walk away and you'll find the next better one.
        2. Determine your opening offer
            1. Opening offer: Your lowest price offered to the seller that you'll buy. It should be beyond your best but still possible.
                1. Walk-away limit is internal based. Opening offer is external based, that the seller has chance to accept
                2. Opening offer needs market research. The going rate is from "a few people will pay, but most will reject it".
        3. Prepare your tradables
            1. Tradables: Things other than the price that can be exchanged in the negotiation.
                1. For example: packaging, time, extra info, support
                    1. Everything except money has a different value to both parties
                2. "I can give you a training worth of $1000, rather than actual 1000 dollar cash"
                3. Also, to justify your reduction of price
                4. Make a list, prepare
                    1. What I want, what they want?
                    2. What I can offer, what they can offer?
        4. Prepare their weakness
            1. E.g. buying a house from a seller: The house has problem, the house owner is pressing hard, the seller may lose job
            2. Avoid yourself sink into the weakness thought. and, bet they have. "I bet they are in such a time pressure to sell it".
               Focus the weaknesses the other person possesses

    4. Opening Offers
        1. Don't open first
            1. Just ask a lot of questions and listen. this is when to learn their weakness
            2. What if you were asked about opening price first? Push it back it back
                1. "Well .. it depends .." then ask the question to them "Do you have a budget in mind?"
        2. Calculate your opening offer
            1. If you think the seller's lowest offer is 420, you need to ask for 405.
               The opening offer is a probe to find the opponent's walk-away number.
               And a strike to rock the opponent's foundation.
        3. Watch of the flinch
            1. The body language of flinch
                1. Intake of breath
                2. Looking unhappy
                3. Turning away
                4. Words of disappointment
                5. Putting the pen down
            2. Always flinch once the other party delivers their opening offer
                1. even you are delighted
                2. Don't say nothing. Saying nothing is a signal of happy. People have no point to hide unhappy, but may hide happy.
            3. When you open, you want the other party to flinch
                1. If they don't flinch, it means they are happy with your opening offer. Then it means you gave a bad opening offer.
                2. Watch if their flinch is real, watch the body language
        4. Don't use round numbers
            1. Round numbers look more like faked
            2. Given a $500,000 house, instead of offering $450,000, offer $442,000
            3. Move by small steps. Round number is against it.

    5. Tactics
        1. Try the vice techniques
            1. Offer price -> "Can you reduce it a little bit more?" "It's still too much, ..."
            2. respond against vice -> "But how much exactly"
               "Well, if you gave me cash up front and a recommendation to your group of companies, then I could do it for $285"
               "What price do you think it's reasonable then" -> This is asking for opening offer
                1. yet respond -> "Well, a lot less than $300. That's for sure." -> "How much exactly?"
        2. Try the knocking the production
            1. "It's not bright enough. I'm not sure." "It's a bit rusty .."
            2. Respond: "That's already reflected in the price." "That's why the price is so reasonable".
                1. When someone knocks the product, they are still investigating it
        3. Try the reluctant buyer technique
            1. Claim: You are not ready. You boss / your wife. You don't want to buy it, but you keep receiving pressure.
            2. Respond: Realize it's just a tactic. Don't be influenced. Tell yourself, they are probably desperate to sell
        4. Try hiding the value of tradables
            1. If it's something you want, claim you don't. If it's something you don't want, claim you do
               Save your main requirement until later in the negotiation. Then mention it casually as a tradable
               For the thing you don't want, but pretend do, trade it for other prices
        5. Try the Salami Tactic
            1. Asking for slices, gradually shave concessions off of the other person - 切香肠战术
            2. Example: Lily and me
               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-skills/try-the-salami-technique?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
            3. Combat the Salami Tactic
                1. Trade one thing for another. "If you want the packaging, the special delivery needs to be pushed off"
                2. Counterattack on a complete different front. "We can do the packaging and the weekend delivery, but it'll cost your more" Or "You have to order 100 boxes"
                3. Say the deal no longer works for you
        6. Try time pressure
            1. Type of time pressure
                1. How much time do they have? Booked flight? Someone just want to get the deal and get out? Watch the body language
                2. Do they receive strong push from the boss? Budget must spent at the end of year.
                3. Package has freshness requirement? Price may change in a few days?
                4. The deal must be done before Christmas?
            2. Look for clues to others' weakness. Don't tell your own.

    6. Trading
        1. Get to win-win with tradables
            1. E.g. book course further ahead, you gain price, the author gain income secure
            2. TRADABLES other than PRICE are why WIN-WIN is POSSIBLE
        2. Use trading to get a better deal
            1. Start your negotiation with room to maneuver
            2. Trading is far better than Conceding. Trading: "If you can cut the price by 10%, I can pay you up front"
                1. Conceding also makes the opponent thinks the gap is empty, it's a lie, it's and an INSULT
                2. DO TRADING INSTEAD OF CONCEDING. It's also a matter of respect
            3. Example: Lily and me
               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-skills/use-trading-to-get-a-better-deal?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
        3. Use small steps
            1. Instead of giving from $4800 to $4000, give a smaller step like $200.
                1. It's also a signal that the price is empty
            2. Only move small steps. And, start from your opening offer. "I can offer X, but if you give me <tradable>, I can increase it by a little bit"
        4. Learn from an example of poor negotiation
            1. https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-skills/learn-from-an-example-of-poor-negotiation?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
            2. Negotiation Errors
                1. Go straight from opening offer to his limit. It sends a confusing signal to the opponent.
                2. Not persisting
                3. Not being polite
                4. There are so many tradables to negotiation about the price, but he didn't try and directly hang up
                    5. Don't use round numbers, it leads against "move small steps", and make tradable negotiation harder
        5. Identify weak spots in negotiation
            1. Example: Lily and me
               https://www.linkedin.com/learning/negotiation-skills/identify-weak-spots-in-negotiation?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=3322
                1. Useful, as it compares the good and bad case
                2. Should do
                    1. Move by small step. Don't use round numbers
                    2. Don't do conceding. It would question the credit. Be sure to trade.

    7. Closing
        1. Avoid final offer
            1. Never say "That's my final offer". It's not true. If it's true, it means you are dealing at walk-away number, which is bad.
                1. instead say, "I can't go lower/higher than that, really not."
            2. Don't ask "Is that your final offer?". This will pin the opponent at the price, they cannot give you lower.
            3. Tradables are your way out
        2. Avoid splitting the difference
            1. Buyer $800, Seller $850. "How about split the difference, say $825?"
            2. Split the difference is a signal that you're ready to pay their figure.
                1. Don't concede. Trade
                2. Respond: "I really can't go beyond $800. My husband/wife/boss .."
            3. If the sale is broken, you can reel them back, saying "It's a shame if we give up at so close .. how about in the middle, $813"
                1. Splitting the splitting of difference
        3. Watch out for the nibble technique
            1. The Nibble - The opponent asks for something at the end of a negotiation.
                1. You must reject it. Don't show weakness. The opponent now knows you want to buy it
                2. Or, ask for Trade, rather than concession
                3. About halfway through the negotiation, ask whether there are any extras you need to know about.
        4. Learn to manage the quivering pen technique
            1. Quivering Pen - The opponent asks for something extra at the end *right before* you make your agreement
                1. Don't concede, stay strong.
                2. If deal is off, reel them back.
        5. Know when to walk away from a deal
            1. When it looks like a deal won't happen
                1. Try again to find tradable that works
                2. Otherwise, you have to pay up, or walk away. Know your walk-away point
        6. Practice with low-risk negotiation
            1. Practice Negotiating
                1. Where negotiating is expected
                2. When you don't want the item
                3. If you know it's cheaper elsewhere
                4. When you can't afford the item
                6. When you don't have time pressure

3. My own notes for management and leading the team
    1. The biggest frown of a dev is, I (dev) wrote the code (spent a lot of time) but you (manager) changed the requirement
       The biggest fear of a manager is, I (manager) asked you (dev) the build something but you came back with not what I asked
        1. THE TWO ARE THE SAME PROBLEM. Communication with clarity and early engagement is so important.
           All eventually lead to whether the leader are effectively building the capital to effectively MOTIVATE people

            7. SG&A - Selling, general, and administrative expenses
                1. SG&A usually are similar with operating expense
                2. Operating expense - rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, and funds allocated for research and development

    3. Your business model
        1. Define your products and services
            1. Example: light truck manufacturer
                1. People's problem to solve by you
                2. Market - customer individual and firms
                    1. Narrow down into small market, be precise to your particular market
                        1. E.g. only low end, excluding high end.
            2. Go speak with sales persons to get more understanding
        2. Build your offering
            1. Look into the input and output of your products
                1. Example: A car company vs a credit card company vs a restaurant
            2. Get into know your organization
            3. Manufacturing
                1. In-house
                2. Outsourcing
                3. Partnership
        3. Price strategy
            1. A 1% difference on the top line price is worth a 10% profit increase on a business with a 10% gross margin.
            2. Price model
                1. One time fee
                2. Subscription model
                3. A razor and blade model
                4. Sell accessories or extras with your core product
                5. Offering additional services or warranties
                6. Difference prices for different customers, markets, and features
            3. Cost-plus pricing model vs value-based pricing model
                1. Cost-plus: Look at cost first, and the mark it up by desired profit margin.
                    1. E.g. instructing a course, No matter how many people is in the room, it's a fixed fee
                2. Value-based: We think through the value we are delivering and we want a portion of that value as the fee
                    1. Every person in that room will be charged with a fee.
        4. Growth strategy
            1. How does business grow?
                1. E.g. geo-graphics expansion, or selling new products, or selling same products to new customers
                2. E.g. growing by acquisition and buying other business
            2. Methodologies
                1. Look at historical growth, it's a pretty well indicator
                2. Look at the market plan and find where is the future growth
            3. Methods
                1. Acquisition
                    1. When you are looking for synergies
                    2. You are also buying a piece of market
                        1. Sell old product to new market
                        2. Sell bought product to old market
                    3. Also, consolidate duplicate departments to reduce cost
                2. Organic
                    1. You investigate heavily in sales and marketing, eventually your get scale and grow
                3. Geo-graphics expansion
                    1. You make large investment upfront in the new market, and eventually the sales pick up
                    2. Economic profile - huge upfront that you build supply chain and market presence in the new market
                4. New products
                    1. Costly research and development, and market launching, and getting distribution
                    2. Getting a large growth impact quickly by selling new product to existing base of customers

                5. Examples
                    1. A major healthcare grows by buying new hospitals in a geography they haven't entered yet. That's a lot of money upfront. They integrate that hospital and reduce the cost. And then they push existing services and existing market capabilities through that new hospital and grow geographic presence.
                    2. A huge software firm. They do a lot of small acquisitions with new capabilities and then get bolted on to their core platform. Sell it to existing clients, say we have a new module. You're already using our big system, you should buy this module too. Or they can go to the customers from acquisition and say you're already using these modules, how about buying the big system that can support it even more broadly.
                    3. The instructor's firm looks for organic growth. We have core business. We try to land new clients or penetrate existing clients with other offerings.

    4. Your financials
        1. Understand profit and loss
            1. Volume of selling, pricing, discount give
            2. P&L statement: Revenue -> COGS -> gross profit -> operating expenses (SG&A) -> operating profit -> interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization -> net income
            3. P&L is critical to understand business
                1. Also, compare history reports
                2. LOOK AT MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL BRIEF, AND TRY TO TIE THEIR EXPLANATIONS TO THE NUMBERS IN P&L (ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT)

        2. Know your performance levers
            1. Performance levers
                1. Revenue levers

                3. Stores, fixtures (shelves, display cases)
            5. shorter vs midterm vs longterm levers
                1. Also, in different industries the levers are different, see examples
                2. You need to understand the levers particularly for your industry
                3. Also, watch the ripple effect of the levers
            6. Understanding the levers helps you understand how company decisions are made, and how those decisions impact business
        3. Access trends
            1. Trends indicate business performance over time
            2. General trends
                1. Sales and profit

                2. Utilization
                3. Fill rate (Is your product immediately available in inventory for your customers?)
                4. Cost per account
            5. Read the annual reports
                1. pay attention to the trends
                2. DON'T READ THE SUMMARY, ANALYZE THE INFORMATION FOR YOURSELF
                    1. See if you can predict how management would explain that trend and what actions they plan on taking to change it.
                    2. Get you prepared to pull the right levers when you see a trend going in specific direction

    5. Your strategy
        1. Access the competitive environment
            1. Porter's Five Forces
                1. Competitive Rivalry
                    1. How competitors in your industry behave
                    2. How many are there?
                    3. Are they rational or irrational?
                    4. Do they collaborate or compete fiercely?
                2. Buyer Power
                    1. How much power do your customer have over you?
                    2. E.g. You only have few big customers
                    3. E.g. You have a very distributed customer base
                3. Supplier Power
                    1. Organizations you buy products and services from
                    2. E.g. Only one raw material supplier available - High supplier power
                    3. E.g. Buy raw materials from a lot of different companies and it's undifferentiated - littler supplier power
                4. Threat of New Entry
                    1. What's the likelihood that a new competitor will entry and compete with you
                    2. Key point is barriers to entry.
                    3. E.g. Does it cost a lot of money to entry, build a new factory, create entirely new products - low threat of entrance
                    4. E.g. Just put up a website and be in business next day - high threat of entrance
                5. Threat of Substitution
                    1. What's the likelihood that your product or service can be substituted for something else.
                    2. E.g. your product is highly differentiated, not easy to get replaced

        2. Define how you'll compete and win
            1. To win through core competencies
                1. Ask your business, what are we well at
                    1. E.g. Time to go to market
                    2. E.g. Capability to deliver, Turnaround time
                    3. E.g. cost position
                    4. E.g. Quality of your products
                    5. E.g. Your company is more innovative than others
                    6. E.g. A world-class supply chain
                    7. E.g. Your brand or features and functionalities of your products
                    8. E.g. Are you great at life cycle management?
                    9. E.g. Customer relationship management
                2. You have to BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW YOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE POSITIONED IN THE MARKETPLACE, because that will help customers and competitors know this is what makes us great.
                    1. By your competitors knowing what you're great at there's less likelihood they're going to compete for the same space.
                    2. E.g. name Apple, Walmart, Costco, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Google, CAN YOU TELL WHAT ARE THEIR CORE COMPETENCIES?
                3. You should create a list of what you think your possible points of differentiation are.
                    1. What are the core competencies for your business?
                    2. Once you have that list ASK YOUR COLLEAGUES WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE. See which items on that list get mentioned more than others. More likely than not those are your true core competencies.

        3. Evaluate your initiative pipeline
            1. What is Initiative Pipeline?
                1. When organizations make investments in projects or in infrastructure, many times that's in the form of an initiative.
                2. The sum of all those initiatives makes up your initiative pipeline.
                3. Understanding what projects are in the pipeline will help you understand how the organization is going to change over time.
                4. An initiative pipeline helps you track all the investments your business is making
            2. Investment portfolio unfold the future path of your business
                1. You can go ask for the initiative list from the folks who run that process
            3. Find out why you're making the investments you're making
                1. What's the rationale behind them?
                2. How does the initiative improve the business?
                3. How are they tied to the strategy?

            4. Many times when people are making a recommendation to have an initiative approved, they have to write a short abstract that says, "this is how this initiative will improve the business, and this how this initiative is tied to the broader strategy."
                1. IF YOU LOOK AT AN INITIATIVE AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S OFF-STRATEGY, ASK WHY THE ORGANIZATION IS PURSUING IT.
                2. E.g. sometime, it's a regulatory requirement, or it's a safety issue.
                3. E.g. the initiative is really off-strategy, which should consider stopping it.
                4. E.g. I work with one client, that had a large portfolio of projects. They were looking at new products, acquisitions, supply chain improvements, technology upgrades, and opening new facilities. Their strategy wasn't very clear. And some of the initiatives seemed pretty random, especially one acquisition. The thing is, the CEO wanted to pursue that acquisition. After spending some time with the team refining their strategy, and their strategic plan, they had better clarity around where the organization was going. It became clear to the CEO that that one acquisition was way off-strategy. Now, to his credit, he stepped back and said, "This is where the organization is going, that initiative goes in a different direction, and if we make that acquisition, it's off-strategy, so we should stop." He took it off the list.
                    1. Having that clarity around the DIRECTION for the organization, helped shape that initiative pipeline.
                    2. When you look at the pipeline for your organization, ask yourself the same set of questions. Why are we pursuing this initiative? And how does it drive our strategy forward.

        4. Set priorities
            1. How are priories in your organization determined?
                1. Who manages that process?
                2. How are new ideas submitted?
                3. What kind of business case do you need to get the projects approved?
                    1. Find a project that's in the pipeline. Go speak with the sponsor and ask them what it takes to get that idea on the list and, ultimately, executed.

                4. E.g. I worked with one organization that had a very formal prioritization process. There was a monthly meeting. Each team came into that meeting with their own prioritized list of projects. The projects needed a business case, so every project on the list had a document supporting the rationale for pursuing that initiative. That business case had to be approved by the department head before it even made it on the department's prioritization list. At the monthly meeting, all the different lists from all the departments were brought together. It was determined for the entire division what the top priorities were.
                    1. If I went in with my list, I had my five ideas on it, well, it may turn out that my number one idea may be third or fourth on the overall prioritization list.
                    2. But by managing that process rigorously, we knew what initiatives were in the pipeline, and what it took to get them to the top of the list so they would be executed.

                5. E.g. I worked with another organization that had a much less formal process. Each department had their own budget, and every project they wanted to do was self-funded out of their own budget. Priorities were set by the business unit head, and the prioritization responsibilities were often delegated out to individual teams or functional areas. Each team, in turn, had their own budget, but they could ask for more money if they had a bigger project that was outside of the scope of their existing budget.

            2. When you understand the prioritization process,
                1. from the initial recommendation through execution,
                2. you'll have a much better sense of how to take your ideas and make them happen.

            2. Marketing models
                1. Advertising or online adverting
                2. TV or radio
                3. Who's your buyer and how you reach them

                4. E.g. marketing brands directly to consumer, though through retailers. The company is able to tell retailers how to market the product and price it, how to set it up on shelves. Because this company owns the relationship with customers, there is no the distributors would be able to cut them out of that relationship.

                5. E.g. sells directly to consumers, there is no sales people. Sales are made directly through mail, television, internet. The only sales people the organization had were for making partnership deals with third parties so that they could then in turn sell our products.

                6. E.g. For my firm, it's a consultative selling model. Most of our sales calls are to senior executives. The purchases are large. And it can take a long time to go from the first conversation to an actual sale. I just had a sale this morning that I've been working on for nine months. My first conversation was with one executive to understand their requirements, then I had to spend more time with other execs to understand their concerns and considerations. And then I had to put together a proposal that we turned over multiple times and we refined until finally we had the right package for this customer and they were able to say "We wanna buy it."

        3. Understand research and development
            1. R&D Lead Times
                1. Internet business - short
                2. Consumer packages products - middle
                3. Pharmaceuticals - long
            2. What kind of R&D do your organization do?
                1. Instead, buying innovation is lucrative and fast.
                2. R&D for new products, or cost reduction, or changing process
            3. R&D models depend on business model
                1. E.g. Pharmaceuticals long and formal
                    1. How to speed R&D? Solution: buy small companies that sell small molecules that weren't a drug yet

                2. E.g. Consumer package products company. Lots of innovations around formulations, new flavors, new packaging. Also R&D in manufacturing and process.
                3. A financial services firm. No R&D at all. Instead, innovation was embedded within teams' daily word. If the team had a new idea, they will do market testing, and roll it out.

            4. Clues to figure out what your company's R&D model is
                1. Read the annual report
                2. Look for what innovations are being considered by management
                3. Figure out how did those innovations come to market
                4. Review recent product launches or enhancements
                5. Find stakeholders who led successful projects, and ask them

        4. Develop new products
            1. What's the process to create new product in your organization?
                1. Who decides what products to launch?
                2. What market research is done to support those new product launches
                3. How long does it take to create a new product?
            2. How do you protect new products after they get into market?
                1. Patents, copyrights
                2. Speed to market
                3. Achieve scale
                4. Put a brand and build relationship with your customer

                5. E.g. I've seen include a small internet company where new products were created by the team. The team had an idea, they launched it quickly, they tested, and they learned, and then they refined from there. The way they were going to protect these ideas was to try and scale as quickly as possible, be first to market.
                    1. They weren't going to spend a lot of money and time trying to patent the technology because those patents could be easily defeated and it would take a long time to get them.

                6. E.g. A consumer package products company I worked with looks at product development from the standpoint of doing rigorous market research. They talk to a lot of consumers and understand what their wants and needs are. They then look at their existing product portfolio and figure out where are the holes. Our consumers are saying they want this, we only have this. There's a gap that we should probably fill. They talk with consumers and jointly develop some of these products. They would develop prototypes, test those prototypes, and then scale the winning formulations.
                    1. Once they got a product to market they did have copyright and patent protection for some of the products where they could get it.
                7. I worked with a large pharmaceutical company that had long lead times to go from an idea to a new product in the market. They had to invest very heavily in research and development. They did massive clinical trials to prove the efficacy of the new treatment.
                    1. To protect their new product they had patents that were put in place to protect their intellectual property or IP.
                    2. They tried to get to scale as quickly as possible and get as many patients as they could on their treatment before competitors got a treatment in the marketplace.

        5. Manage people
            1. What types of people do you have?
                1. Hourly
                2. Salaried
                3. Contractors
            2. How are your employees paid?
                1. How are employees measured by their performance?
                2. What is your turnover?
                3. What about training?
                4. Where do you recruit from?
                    1. Finding people
                    2. Bringing them into your organization
            3. What does your org chart look like?
                1. Flat vs Hierarchical

            4. E.g. In my organization, we're very flat. All my instructors are contractors. I don't have employees. They're all senior-level staff. All their compensation is commission-based. If they sell something, they make money. If they don't sell anything, they don't make any money. Everyone has an incentive to sell and teach and write content because we deliver training. It leads me to recruit a very specialized type of person. Now, it's harder for me to find these people, however, when I do find them and when they understand the model that we have, I end up with very low turnover. I've had people on my team for over a decade and they're not going anywhere anytime soon.
            5. E.g. I've worked with a client that had franchise restaurants. They have restaurants all over the country and it's all fast food. Now being franchises, those restaurants are owned by entrepreneurs. The company doesn't own them. Those entrepreneur owners hire front-line hourly people. They're paid based on the hours that they work. Now, these jobs are hard and they're pretty low skill so there's very high turnover and they're constantly hiring and recruiting new people.
                1. Performance is based on that person's output and their organization charts tend to be very hierarchical.
                2. So their business model is driving their people strategy and the way they can improve their operations is by improving their turnover, which means they train their people better or they recruit more intelligently.

            5. BUSINESS MODEL DRIVES THEIR PEOPLE STRATEGY. AGAIN, PEOPLE DRIVE OPERATIONS, WHICH DRIVES PERFORMANCE.
                1. GO AND GET YOUR ORG CHART. LOOK AT THE JOB DESCRIPTIONS FOR PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS OF THAT ORGANIZATION. GO TO YOUR COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND SEE WHAT ROLES YOU'RE HIRING FOR.
                2. Study bonus plans and incentive plans for people below you on the org chart as well as above you.
                3. When you understand how people are paid, it will help you understand why they behave the way they do.
                4. By being able to tie your people strategy to your business strategy, you'll understand how your people operations drive your operational results.
