1. A "Hitchhiker's" Guide to Fast and Efficient Data Reconstruction in Erasure-coded Data Centers    [2014, SIGMOD14, 308 refs, Facebook]
   https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/publications/Hitchhiker_SIGCOMM14.pdf
   Slides: https://www.camdemy.com/media/16288
    1. Related author "K. V. Rashmi". Apply Piggyback Framework on RS code, reduce both network by 25% and disk by 45%. Very good paper.
        1. The key argument is LRC saves reconstruct bandwidth by adding storage overhead, but regenerating code won't
        2. Hitchhiker regenerating applies only when 1 loss, more loss will fallback to plain RS reconstruction (batching the repairs is still favorable)
        2. Additionally, an Hitchhiker-XOR+ code to trade faster computation with less saving 
        3. Note Piggyback Framework is generally simpler than commonly Regenerating codes.
    2. Highlights
        1. Hitchhiker is implemented at HDFS.
        2. Face evaluation
            1. "We deployed Hitchhiker on a 60-machine test cluster in one of the data centers at Facebook, and evaluated the end to-end functionality of the system."
            2. "We consider the encoding parameters (k = 10 r = 4), a block size of 256MB (unless men tioned otherwise), and a bu er size of 1MB."
        3. "HOP-AND-COUPLE" FOR DISK EFFI CIENCY
            1. Unit is node. Stripe is what ECs together. Shaded blocks in Figure 7 are to be read. Hop distance should be unit size / sub-packet count. I.e, corresponding sub-packets from each stripe are put together.
            2. A finding in Figure 7 is nodes don't read the same amount of data.
            3. Another trade off is a reconstruct read reading a small block can split into 2X IOs.
        4. Hitchhiker XOR+
            1. Requiring one parity to be XOR of each data symbol
    3. My questions
        1. How it compares with Regenerating code / MSR code / Clay Code?
            1. OK ... year 2014, Clay Code (2018) hasn't be published yet, so as Product Matrix MSR Codes (2018)
        2. Upon more losses

            1. Facebook's erasure coding implementation at HDFS
            2. "small file" don't have enough blocks to RAID with. Solution: treat the entire leaf directory as a file to RAID with.

                1. Handling directory change
                    1. The problem of EC with changeable data
                2. When files are replicated across clusters, sometimes parity files are not moved together with their source files. This often leads to data loss.
                    1. The problem of EC doesn't happen within a single data unit

5. Revisiting Network Coding for Warm Blob Storage    [2025, 0 refs, FAST25]
   https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast25-gan.pdf
    1. NCBlob that optimizes EC on small blob with Split-merge-encode scheme (Figure 5) and Merge-split-encode scheme (Figure 6) and F-MSR (non-systematic). Large blobs can still use Clay Code.
    2. Highlights
        1. Design idea: Performing encoding on the group of data with access locality
        2. Split-merge-encode scheme
            1. my questions
                1. IO amplification is a small blob is future cut into sub-blobs?
        3. Hybrid MSR codes for all blobs
            1. determining the blob size threshold to switch between F-MSR vs Clay Code
                1. repair time is dominated by disk seek time when blob size decreases. NCBlob favors small blob because it reduces seek time by reducing sub-packetization. In generational, non-systematic MSR can reduce sub-packetization.

   https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast25/presentation/liu-jing
   https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast25_slides-liu-jing.pdf
    1. Interesting new direction of microkernel FS. The key problem to solve is how to selectively reply the operation logs for fast process crash recovery
    2. Highlights
        1. Introduction
            1. Microkernel FS allows app and OS to continue after FS crash. But how should FS do recovery? The in-memory FS states are lost.
        2. P-Log and AIM (Act, Ignore, Modify)
            1. Figure 4: Intuition behind P-Log and AIM. The chart is useful as to list FS operations and their categories
            2. Figure 2: P-log by design survives after FS crash. New FS process uses P-log and only P-log to recover the state gap.
            3. The key challenges are, we must selectively replay P-Log.
                1. Some updates may have already been durable
                2. Some states can be affected by later states
                3. Operations that do no update state do no need to be replayed
                4. See Figure 3: P-log design
