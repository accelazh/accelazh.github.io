I have written some examples for 3 kinds of nova api extension and cover most features:
  
* **Resource extension**: which creates a new resource, actually a collection of object.
* **Controller extension**: which extends existing resource.
* **Child resource extension**: which creates a new resource. The resource is child of another parent resource.

These examples contain rich document for learning.

Also how to curl these extension APIs are documented. These are very useful.
