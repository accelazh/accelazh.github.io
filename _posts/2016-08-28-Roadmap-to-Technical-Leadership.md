I summarize the roadmap to be an expert of certain technology

  * Master the full technology stack from kernel to app level, to market dynamics and the big picture

  * Build the path of how newest information flow and propagate

  * Raise your industry influence

An expert knows where is the cutting edge and innovate the next step. Impact by influence.

### Master the Technology Stack

To master the technology stack, you need to solid foundation and grasp the cutting edge

  * Understand each layer of the technology, till deep into the Kernel

  * Understand the peripheral related technologies

  * Understand the history, motivations, pro & cons, usecases, comparisons, etc

  * Understand the current status, future movements, problems to be solved, etc

It also includes good market understanding

  * Understand the market adoptions, key users and their concerns

  * Understand key players, vendors, startups and each of their divisions, advantanges and killer usecases

  * Understand the ecosystems, market dynamics and the globally big picture  

### Build Information Flow

An expert needs where to obtain the cutting edge updates and knows what is going on underwater about future directions.

  * The connections with people and discussions on-site summits/conferences are usually sources of underwater future.

  * Dev maillists, code reviews, newsletters/blogs, summits/conferences releases, show community moves (former ones are faster)

  * Identify the core devs / key persons and subscribe their blogs

  * Read research papers, recommended from top level conferences. Their background analysis & related works are good.

  * Good vertical news media, community driven new feeds, major techical news websites

  * Some Weichat public subscriptions (usually personal account) and Weichat groups are of high value

  * Social medias and their hotness burst are also a source to find new moves

  * Stay with good people, stay in the circle accounts a lot

  * Others: recruiting JD reveals concret trends, e.g. interns requirements by research lab.

Use strategic thinking to watch market moves and find technology updates

  * Watch big players' / competitors' moves, their new investiments and portfolio changes

  * Watch upstream community moves and code commits

  * Watch foundation investments and what groups/projects are newly established

  * Watch major product releases and their featurings.

  * Related patents (if allowed to read) usually reflex true technical compentency other than sales pitch

  * Watch financial investiments, new startups, fundings, etc to find market-acceptable technology updates

### Raise Industry Influence

It's the contribution you made, the exposusre & visibility, the connects with people, and the reputation.
